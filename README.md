# Arcadia Computational Training

This repository houses computational training materials developed for or delivered at Arcadia.
The repository is still a work in progress so things may shift around as we settle on an organizational structure.

The content in this repository is meant to present a sensible set of defaults for common computational tasks in biology at the time that the content is added to the repo.
