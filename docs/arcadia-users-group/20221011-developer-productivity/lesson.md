# How to use the AWS S3 command line tool

In the last couple of weeks, we learned many [shell](../20220906-intro-to-shell1/lesson.md) and [git](../../workshops/20220920-intro-to-git-and-github/lesson.md) commands. This week, we'll take a step back to learn about using an integrated development environment (IDE) to develop our scripts/pipelines and customizing our terminals with shortcuts and git visualizations.

## Accessing the shell for this lesson

For this lesson, we need to have access to a Unix shell.
If you're not sure how to open a terminal on your computer, see [these instructions](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html).
