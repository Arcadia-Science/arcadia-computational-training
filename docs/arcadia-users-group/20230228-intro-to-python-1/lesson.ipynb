    "\n",
    "Python is a popular programming language. It was designed to be easy to read in comparison to other programming languages, so it's a great first programming language to learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This lesson** covers the following basics of Python, such as:\n",
    "- variables\n",
    "- data types\n",
    "- built-in functions\n",
    "- creating custom functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the following lessons, we'll cover more basics of Python, including:\n",
    "- data structures\n",
    "- loops\n",
    "- conditional expressions\n",
    "- packages\n",
    "- methods\n",
    "- debugging\n",
    "- ... and more!\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this workshop series, you'll have enough experience with Python to be able to write your own basic Python scripts. You'll also have enough knowledge of Python to be able to use the OpenTrons API (Application-Program Interface) to control our in-house liquid handling robot, covered in the upcoming Intro to OpenTrons series.\n",

    "### 0.1 Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first workshop, we'll work in an interactive computing environment called a Jupyter notebook. To run a \"cell\" of code in Jupyter, you'll simply press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> from inside the cell. The result of the cell - the output - will display just below the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can tell if a cell has successfully executed based on the `[ ]` text to the left of the cell. A cell that is in progress has an asterisk `[*]`, and a cell that has completed has a number `[1]`.\n",

    "> Despite this, many Python tools and packages make reference to snakes, such as packages you may have heard us talk about before: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), etc."
