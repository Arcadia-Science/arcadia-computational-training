(8 minutes to download and setup)
2. Ensure all students have PreForm software installed on their laptops. PreForm from Formlabs can be downloaded [here.](https://formlabs.com/software/#preform) (Takes 1 minute to download. No login required)
3. Students need a mouse with a middle-click button to use Autodesk Fusion 360 software.
4. Set up the Form2 SLA printer and have it ready for demonstration. (Galo will do this)
5. Arrange for various types of SLA resins for demonstration purposes. (Galo will do this)
6. Prepare basic safety equipment (goggles, gloves) for handling SLA resins. (General lab PPE)

### Other types of printers:

- [FDM Printers](https://www.prusa3d.com): More common, uses a plastic filament.
- [DLP Printers](https://www.dynamism.com/lux-creo-lux-3-plus.html): Similar to SLA, but uses a digital light projector screen.
- [SLS Printers](https://formlabs.com/3d-printers/catalog/#fuse-1+-30w): Uses lasers to sinter powdered material.

### FDM vs SLA printing

FDM printers, like the Prusa printer at Arcadia, are based on 3-axis CNC machines common in the manufacturing industry. These printers extrude a plastic filament through a hot end, layer by layer building up material and printing your part. FDM printers are easy and inexpensive to use and have gained huge popularity. 

SLA printing, in contrast, uses light to polymerize a growing resin structure from a solution of monomers. This method is capable of printing intricate and complex designs, including high-resolution parts and shapes that cannot be achieved easily on an FDM print bed. 

For most users, resolution requirements will determine which printer is most appropriate. FDM printers are great for rapid prototyping, medium-sized parts, and basic 3D objects, but resolutions lower than 1 mm are difficult to achieve. SLA printers can print all the same parts as FDM printers, but with significantly increased resolution (down to 100 um) and freedom in the design process. FDM printers are somewhat limited in the resin properties, with most resins being a sort of hard, chemically weak plastic. Meanwhile, SLA printers can print a wide range of resins and elastomers with different physical and chemical properties. Finally, FDM printers are simpler to operate and do not involve reactive resins or solvents, while SLA printing is a more involved procedure with clear, albeit mild, chemical hazards.
