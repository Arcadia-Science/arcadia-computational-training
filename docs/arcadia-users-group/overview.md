# Arcadia Users' Group

Arcadia Users’ Group (AUG) is a forum to bring your biological data and discuss high level conceptual problems (what is genome assembly?), low level coding problems (what does this error message even mean?!), and everything in between. 
Like the start codon, AUG aims to get you started on projects and help you get re-started after you run into problems. 
Come to this group’s informal meetups with your own questions or to help others answer theirs. 
AUG is a two hour weekly (virtual) meetup. 
We will periodically offer 20 minute - 1 hour training sessions. 
The rest of the time will be open office hour-style time to ask and answer questions and to co-work on data-relevant problems.

What is a Users’ group?
A users’ group is a club focused on a computer-related technology. 
Unlike python users’ groups (PUGs) and R users’ groups (RUGs), AUG is language- and technology-agnostic. 
We focus on anything Arcadians need to be successful with their data-related biology.

This is the landing page for tutorials delivered during AUG sessions. 

## Upcoming trainings

The schedule is subject to change.

| Date | Tutorial | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Sept 12, 2022 | [Introduction to the command line part 2](20220912-intro-to-shell2/lesson.md) | This next lesson on the command line covers how to create and (re)move directories and files (`mkdir`, `rmdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`) and how to investigate the contents of a file thoroughly (`less`, `wc`, `grep`) |
| Sept 19, 2022 | How to use S3 with the command line interface (CLI) | Arcadia uses Amazon Web Services S3 to store some files remotely. This lesson introduces a tools that enables command line access to S3 |
| Sept 26, 2022 | Tentative: How to build a website with GitHub and MkDocs | Following our Git and GitHub workshops, this lesson will help you flex your Git skills by demonstrating how to build a website using Git, GitHub, and MkDocs. | 
| Oct 3, 2022   | Conda for software installation | In bioinformatics, we often use mulitiple software tools to answer a research question. In this lesson, we will learn how to use conda to install software. Conda is a software installation and management system that helps us conduct reproducible analyses while avoiding software conflicts. | 
| Oct 10, 2022  | Indigenous peoples' day, no meeting | |
| Oct 17, 2022  | Conda for environment management | In the previous lesson, we learned how conda works and how to install software. In this lesson, we'll learn how to organize our software installations into environments, and how to use environments to ensure our analyses are repeatable. | 
| Oct 24, 2022  | Turn a GitHub repo into a collection of interactive notebooks with Binder | This week we’ll introduce Binder, an executable environment that makes your code immediately reproducible by anyone, anywhere. |

|------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Sept 6, 2022  | [Introduction to the command line part 1](20220906-intro-to-shell1/lesson.md) | The command line is an essential interface to control remote computers or to execute automated analysis. This lesson introduces the concept of the command line, shows how to look at files (`ls`, `head`, `tail`), and how to navigate around a computer (`cd`, `pwd`) | [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5htHR2AmxY) | 
| Aug 29, 2022  | [Project organization and file & resource management](20220829-project-organization/lesson.md) | It’s not uncommon to generate thousands of files during a bioinformatics analysis. In this lesson, we will cover project organization strategies for keeping track of the files we generate and how we generate them. Be kind to future you: a little organization effort now can save hours of headache later! | [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmYbLdCixSM) |
| Aug 22, 2022 | [Introduction to markdown syntax](20220822-intro-to-markdown-syntax/lesson.md) | Markdown is a lightweight markup language (think HTML or LaTeX but…lighter) that’s used by lots of websites and software (Slack and Notion and GitHub, oh my!). This quick introduction will show you how to easily format plain text that is readable and that renders into beautifully formatted documents. | [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8NB3n2URT8) |
