# Arcadia Users' Group

Arcadia Users’ Group (AUG) is a forum to bring your biological data and discuss high level conceptual problems (what is genome assembly?), low level coding problems (what does this error message even mean?!), and everything in between. 
Like the start codon, AUG aims to get you started on projects and help you get re-started after you run into problems. 
Come to this group’s informal meetups with your own questions or to help others answer theirs. 
AUG is a two hour weekly (virtual) meetup. 
We will periodically offer 20 minute - 1 hour training sessions. 
The rest of the time will be open office hour-style time to ask and answer questions and to co-work on data-relevant problems.

What is a Users’ group?
A users’ group is a club focused on a computer-related technology. 
Unlike python users’ groups (PUGs) and R users’ groups (RUGs), AUG is language- and technology-agnostic. 
We focus on anything Arcadians need to be successful with their data-related biology.

This is the landing page for tutorials delivered during AUG sessions.
