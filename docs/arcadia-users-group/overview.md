# Arcadia Users' Group

Arcadia Users’ Group (AUG) is a forum for Arcadians to bring their biological data and discuss high level conceptual problems (what is genome assembly?), low level coding problems (what does this error message even mean?!), and everything in between.
Like the start codon, AUG aims to get Arcadians started on projects and help them get re-started after they run into problems.
AUG is a weekly hybrid meetup.
On training weeks, we offer 20 minute - 1 hour training or code review sessions.
See the tables below for upcoming and past lesson materials.
On non-training weeks, we host a 2 hour hybrid remote/in-person office-hours style working group to ask and answer questions and to co-work on data-relevant problems.

What is a Users’ group?
A users’ group is a club focused on a computer-related technology.
Unlike python users’ groups (PUGs) and R users’ groups (RUGs), AUG is language- and technology-agnostic.
We focus on anything Arcadians need to be successful with their data-related biology.

This is the landing page for tutorials delivered during AUG sessions.
