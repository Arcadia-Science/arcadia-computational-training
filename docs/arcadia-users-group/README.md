# Arcadia Users' Group training materials

This is the location for training materials associated with tutorials given during Arcadia Users' Group. 

## Contributing

Contributions should be made on a branch or fork, integrated via pull request, and reviewed by at least one Arcadian.

Each lesson should be placed in its own folder. 
Folder names should follow the naming convention `DATE-short-description-of-tutorial.md` where dates are formatted as yearmonthdata with noseparaters, short descriptions are concise tags for the content of the lesson and where each word is separated by a hyphen.
Lesson materials should be in markdown format.
Any companion materials to the lesson should be stored in the folder when possible.
If the additional files are too large, download provenance should be recorded clearly in the lesson.
Images rendered inline in the lesson text should also be stored in this folder.
The relative path (e.g. just the file name) can be used to render the image in the lesson.

Lessons are linked from the `overview.md` document, making them discoverable and rendered on arcadia-science.github.io/arcadia-computational-training.
