    "Now that we understand more about conditionals and loops, let's try writing a better version of the `fortune()` script from the last problem set.  \n",
    "This new script should produce the same dialogue and functions as the previous script, and have the following additional behavior:\n",
    "- Checks whether the user inputs non-alphanumeric characters when asked for `name`.\n",
    "    > **Hint:** Check out the `.isalpha()` method [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_isalpha.asp).\n",
    "- Checks whether the user inputs a valid month in the Gregorian calendar in a case-insensitive manner.\n",
    "    - Displays the proper month format when responding.\n",
    "    > **Hint:** A `list` could be useful here.\n",
    "- Checks whether the user provides an `int` or a whole-number `float`.\n",
    "    - Displays the number as an integer when responding.\n",
    "    > **Hint:** There might be a method that does this... try finding it yourself!\n",
    "- If the input is invalid for any reason, prompts the user for input again.\n",
